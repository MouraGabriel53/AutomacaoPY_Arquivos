## 📂 Project Description

This project was developed to automate repetitive tasks related to folder creation, file copying and moving, as well as interactions with the graphical user interface. The main goal is to organize client files into specific folders, making it easier to store and manage quotes. The automation reduces the time spent on manual tasks and minimizes human errors in the process.
- 🆙 **With this project, I reduced the time to create proposals by 25%.**

## ⚙️ Features

- **📁 Automatic folder creation**: Creates folders based on client names or other defined criteria.
- **📄 File copying and moving**: Copies files to the corresponding folders or moves them directly.
- **🖱️ GUI interaction**: Automates clicks and typing to interact with applications and systems.
- **🔧 Customization**: Allows configuring the paths of source and destination folders.

## 📚 Libraries Used

- **os**: Used to interact with the operating system, allowing folder creation and file movement.
- **shutil**: Provides a high-level interface for file copying and moving operations.
- **pyautogui**: Used to automate interactions with the graphical user interface, such as clicks and typing.

These libraries were chosen because they are part of Python's standard library (except pyautogui), eliminating the need to install many external dependencies and simplifying the project implementation.
